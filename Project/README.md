This folder contains the modules needed to implment the project (all in docker containers) . 

The key component is Yolo, the most popular  object dectector that was dockerized and you can pull it from docker hub.

However we packed the full pipeline where you only need to upload the images/videos and all the processing will generate a file with the data.

Use YOLO and Homographies to do traffic analysis : counting, speed, conflict pedestrian/vehicle, risk assessment
